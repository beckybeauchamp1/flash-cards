### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Exceeds Expectations

I think your user stories are awesome! Additionally, I love how you included a whole section about unsolved problems. It was really great to read and see more of your thought process and challenges.

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Meets Expectations

Great job on your first project! Your flash cards game is not only functional, but very creative. 

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Code Quality__: Meets Expectations

I think some of your errors might be more easily identified by abstracting and breaking down some of your methods into smaller functions/objects. This would help with error handling and also achieve code more reusable and DRY code more easily.

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Problem Solving__: Meets Expectations

You did a great job working through your problems, especially working around errors to still get your code functioning!

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?
